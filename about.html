            <p>Hi, my name is Noor Ansari! I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and enjoy tackling complex challengesâ€”whether it is developing software, analyzing data for insights, or exploring the intersection of design, technology, and digital strategy. With experience in multiple programming languages, I am eager to apply my skills in software development, data-driven decision-making, and creative problem-solving. Beyond tech, I am committed to fostering diversity and inclusion in the industry and advocating for equitable opportunities and representation in STEM. I recommend checking out my Projects tab to see some of the projects I have been working on! There, you'll also find links to my LinkedIn and GitHub. <br><br> The reason my passion was able to expand this far is because I'm an avid learner. I absolutely love watching experts in the field do their work, and adapting the lessons into my professional life. Contact me if you're interested in learning more!</p>
